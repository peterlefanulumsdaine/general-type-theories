(** A key notion is the _presuppositions_ of a judgement.

For instance, the judgement [ Γ |- a : A ] has just one presupposition: [ Γ |- A type ].  The judgement [ Γ |- A ≡ B ] has two presuppositions, [ Γ |- A type ] and [ Γ |- B type ].

As with judgements themselves, we first describe set up the combinatorics indexing the constructions involved. *)

Section PresuppositionsCombinatorics.

(** Whenever an object appears in the boundary of an object judgement, then its
    boundary embeds into that boundary.

    NOTE. This is a special case of [boundary_slot_from_presupposition] below.
    It is abstracted out because it’s used twice: directly for object
    judgements, and as part of the case for equality judgements.

    In fact it’s almost trivial, so could easily be inlined; but conceptually
    it is the same thing both times, and in type theory with more judgements,
    it would be less trivial, so we keep it factored out. *)
