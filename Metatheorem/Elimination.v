(** The main goal of this file is the theorem [subst_elimination], showing
that for suitable theories [T], any derivation over [T] using the full
structural rules can be translated into a derivation not using the rules
[subst_apply], [subst_equal].

The main subsidiary lemmas are [subst_apply_admissible] and
[subst_equal_admissible], showing that (generalisations of) these rules are
admissible over the closure system given by [T] together with the other
structural rules.

Note: at the moment, our “susbt-free” structural rules still include the
general renaming rule.  In fact the subst-free derivations we produce will
only require renaming along _equivalences_ of scopes. *)

(* TODO: perhaps restrict the renaming rule (either in general, or just
in [structural_rule_without_subst]) to just the case of equivalences,
so that the results of this file really do show that general renaming is
admissible. *)

Section Raw_Conditions.
(** Conditions on raw rules/type theories sufficient for admissibility of
substitution to hold over them.

  The main such condition is: every rule should have empty conclusion context.
To use one established terminology, all rules should be in _universal form_,
as opposed to _hypothetical form_.

  For substitution to (admissibly) respect equality, we additionally need to
know that the theory is _congruous_, in that for each raw rule of object form,
the associated congruence rule should be derivable (?admissible). *)

  Context {σ} {Σ : signature σ}.

  Definition in_universal_form (R : raw_rule Σ)
    := is_empty (scope_of_judgement (raw_rule_conclusion R)).

  Definition substitutive (T : raw_type_theory Σ)
    := forall r : T, in_universal_form (T r).

  Definition congruous (T : raw_type_theory Σ)
    : Type
  := Family.map
    (Family.bind T
       (fun R => {| family_element R_obj := raw_congruence_rule R R_obj |}))
    T.
  (** More readably: [T] is congruous if for each of its object rules, it also contains the associated congruence rule.

  This is not as general as would ideally be nice: ideally we would say something like “for each object rule, the associated congruence rule is _derivable_ over T”. Unfortunately, the obvious concise ways of saying that all seem to be wrong.

  For instance, our main sense of derivable says that the rule itself is derivable over the translation of T to the metavariable extension; this is bad for two reasons.  First, applying this notion relies on being able to instantiate derivations, which requires either the subst-apply rule or a subst-elimination principle, which will not yet be available at the point we need this.  Secondly, in examples, giving derivations with non-trivial hypotheses (as one does for a congruence rule with binders) may genuinely require use of the subst-apply and subst-eq structural rules.

  An alternative would be to just say that the congruence rule should be _admissible_ over T, or that each instance of it should be derivable.  These would work for the present theorems, but are a bit unnatural; e.g. they’re not preserved under translation or extension of theories.

  The best notion is perhaps obtained by re-defining “derivable rule” to fit the subst-free setting.  For this, we say “the rule’s conclusion should be derivable in the metavariable extension” as before, but instead of saying “…over T, from the rule’s premises”, we convert the premises into extra rules; a premise like [ x:A |- B(x) type ] becomes a pair of rules
[ |- a:A // |- B(a) type ] and [ |- a = a' : A // |- B(a) = B(a') type ].

  With “derivable rule” thus re-defined, taking “congruous” to be “each associated congruence rule is derivable over T” should now work well: it should suffice for the theorems of this file, and be applicable to natural examples (i.e. theories set up using alternative resonable formulations of congruence rules). More generally, this seems to be the right notion of “derivable rule” in the subst-free setting, so would be good to have in general.

  However, it would take a lot of work to state this and set up the infrastructure to work with it.  So for now we stick with this simpler and cruder notion of congruousness: T should literally contain all its associated congruence rules. *)

  (* TODO: this could be improved in several ways, given a bit of upstream refactoring:
  - factor the definition of [RawTypeTheory.closure_system] and the [without subst] version to have the second summand defined together, then have this hold for any closure system with a map from that
  - then can upstream this to [RawTypeTheory] (along with following couple of rules)
  - also can possibly add “contains” relation for families, then rewrite this to use that *)

Section Weakly_Typed_Maps.
(** For [sustitute_derivation], we introduce an auxiliary notion of _weakly

This slightly subtle definition is essentially motivated by the proof
of [substitute_derivation], and in particular, the desire to keep that proof
structurally recursive on the derivation (and also not dependent on any kind
of well-typedness conditions on the raw rules).  The point is that when
passing under binders in premises of rules, we want to extend the substitution
by the type-expressions of the binders, without having to check that these are
well-formed. *)

Section Equality_Substitution.
(** Goal of this section: showing that (generalisations of) the [subst_equal] structural rules are admissible.

That is: given a derivale object judgement, e.g. [ Γ |- a : A ], and two derivably judgementally equal context morphisms [ f, g : Γ' -> Γ ], we should be able to derive [ Γ |- f^*a = g^*a : f^* A ].

That result, [subst_equal_derivation], is the main goal of this section; but to make the inductive proof go through we generalise its statement, to raw substitutions [f g : Γ' -> Γ] that are what we call _weakly judgementally-equal_.

The idea of this is that it generalises judgemental equality so as to be closed under extending a pair [f, g : Δ -> Γ] to extended pairs [Δ;f^*A -> Γ;A] and [Δ;g^*A -> Γ;A], i.e. with the source context extended by either [f^*A] or [g^*A]); and we must do this without any well-formedness check on [A], so we can’t necessarily derive that the extensions are judgementally equal.  Such extensions arise when going under binders in premises of rules.

Since the resulting individual maps [f], [g] may not be weakly-typed substitutions, so not automatically applicable for [substitute_derivation], we also strengthen the induction statement to yield additionally that [ Γ |- f^*a : f^*A ] and [ Γ |- g^*a : g^*A ]. *)

  (** Given a judgement [ Γ |- J ], and a weakly equal pair [ f, g : Γ' -> Γ ],
   a derivation of [ Γ |- J ] yields derivations of two or possibly three
   judgements over [Γ']:
   - [f^* J];
   - [g^* J];
   - if [J] is an object judgement, the associated equality judgement [f^* J = g^* J]

   The proof of this has to treat all three together, since they are each
   defined mutually with the others.

   We thus wrap them up together in the notion of “weakly equal judgement map”:
   a weakly equal map [ [Γ'|-J'] -> [Γ|-J] ] is a weakly equal pair [f,g] from
   [Γ'] to [Γ], such that [J'] is one of the judgements listed above as induced
   from [J] by the [f, g].

   This then allows the theorem [substitute_equal_derivation] to be stated as:
   given a derivation of [ Γ |- J ] and a weakly equal judgement map
   [ [Γ'|-J'] -> [Γ|-J] ], get a derivation of [ Γ' |- J' ].

  Section Raw_Rule_Substitute_Equal_Instantiation.
    (** Analogously to section [Raw_Rule_Substitute_Instantiation],
     the lemmas of this section build up what’s needed for substituting
     raw-rule steps in derivations along weakly equal pairs:

    - given a weakly equal judgement map (f,g) from J' into the conclusion of a raw rule instance I_* R, we get two or three new instantiations: two pulled back instantiations f^*I, g^*I for R, and if R was an object rule, an instantiation (f,g)^*I of the congruence rule of R;

    - the three possible things that J can be are precisely, up to equiv-renaming, the conclusions of these three new rule instances;

    - all of the premises of these new rule instances have weakly equal judgement maps to the premises of the original instance of R.

     The cases for non-raw structural rules amount to showing analogous things for their closure conditions. *)

  Proof.
    (* Sketch proof: should be roughly analogous in organisation to proofs of [rename_derivation], [substitute_derivation] above.

  The sequence of lemmas to handle the raw rule cases should show:

  - given a weakly equal judgement map (f,g) from J' into the conclusion of a raw rule instance I_* R, we get two or three new instantiations: two pulled back instantiations f^*I, g^*I for R, and if R was an object rule, an instantiation (f,g)^*I of the congruence rule of R;

  - the three possible things that J can be are precisely, up to equiv-renaming, the conclusions of these three new rule instances;

  - all of the premises of these new rule instances have weakly equal judgement maps to the premises of the original instance of R.
